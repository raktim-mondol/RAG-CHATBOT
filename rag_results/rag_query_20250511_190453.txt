Query 1: What are Continental Resources' main business operations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The provided context from the financial document (10-K) of Continental Resources does not explicitly outline the main business operations of the company. The document primarily focuses on topics such as shareholding, executive procedures, financial statements, equity investments, and other related matters.

To accurately determine Continental Resources' main business operations, one would typically need to refer to the company's business description or overview section within the 10-K document or the company's website. This section usually provides a detailed explanation of the company's primary activities, products, services, and industry focus.

If you would like, I can assist you in finding this information by conducting additional research on the company's official website or other reliable sources. Would you like me to proceed with this research?

Query 2: What were the total revenues in the most recent fiscal year?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the total revenues in the most recent fiscal year. It primarily focuses on corporate governance, meeting procedures, voting rights, and the long-term incentive plan of Continental Resources, Inc. 

To determine the total revenues in the most recent fiscal year, it would be necessary to refer to the financial statements or the "Income Statement" section of the company's latest annual report (10-K filing with the SEC). This section typically outlines the company's total revenues or net sales generated during the fiscal year.

I recommend accessing Continental Resources, Inc.'s official financial documents, such as their latest 10-K filing, to obtain the precise figure for the total revenues in the most recent fiscal year.

Query 3: What are the key risk factors mentioned in the document?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The provided context from the financial document does not explicitly mention any key risk factors. The document primarily focuses on the organization's governance structure, procedures for conducting meetings of shareholders, regulations related to voting of shares, issuance and transfer of stock certificates, and other related rules and procedures. 

In financial documents like a 10-K filing, key risk factors are typically outlined in a section specifically designated for risk factors. These sections usually highlight various risks that could potentially impact the company's financial performance, operations, or strategic objectives. The risks mentioned could include market risks, regulatory risks, operational risks, competitive risks, financial risks, or other factors that investors should be aware of when considering an investment in the company.

If you are looking for specific key risk factors for the organization, it would be necessary to refer to a different section or source within the financial document that explicitly outlines the risks facing the company.

The provided text does not explicitly mention the company's strategy for oil and gas exploration.
