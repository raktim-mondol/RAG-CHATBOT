# Ingestion Pipeline Design

## Overview

The Ingestion Pipeline is responsible for acquiring financial documents from various sources, parsing them, and segmenting them into logical sections for further processing.

## Functional Requirements (from `requirements.md`)

*   Scrape/download financial reports (PDF, HTML, plain text)
*   Parse and extract structured/unstructured text
*   Segment documents into logical sections (MD&A, Financials, Risk, etc.)

## Working Procedure Steps (from `working_procedure.md`)

*   Schedule downloads/scraping from SEC EDGAR, investor sites
*   Normalize filenames and log source metadata
*   Convert to raw text using PDFMiner/PyMuPDF
*   Apply segmentation rules: identify headers, footnotes, tables

## Detailed Design

### Data Sources

The system will primarily ingest documents from:
*   SEC EDGAR database (for 10-K, 10-Q filings)
*   Company investor relations websites (for earnings call transcripts, reports)
*   Potentially other financial data providers (future expansion)

### Scraping and Downloading

*   Utilize libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` for web scraping HTML content.
*   For SEC EDGAR, use the SEC API or libraries that interface with it.
*   Implement scheduling mechanisms (e.g., using `APScheduler` or a dedicated workflow tool) to regularly check for new filings and reports.
*   Handle various document formats (PDF, HTML, plain text).

### Parsing and Text Extraction

*   For PDF documents, use libraries like `PDFMiner.six` or `PyMuPDF` to extract raw text while attempting to preserve layout information.
*   For HTML documents, use `BeautifulSoup` to extract text content, cleaning up HTML tags and attributes.
*   For plain text documents, direct reading is sufficient.
*   Implement error handling for malformed or unreadable documents.

### Document Segmentation

*   Develop rules and heuristics to identify logical sections within documents (e.g., Management's Discussion and Analysis, Financial Statements, Risk Factors).
*   This can involve pattern matching on headings, analyzing font styles and sizes, and using machine learning models trained on document structure.
*   Store the boundaries of each segment along with the extracted text.

### Metadata and Logging

*   For each ingested document, extract and store relevant metadata such as company name, ticker, document type (10-K, 10-Q, etc.), filing date, source URL, and original filename.
*   Log the ingestion process, including success/failure status, timestamps, and any errors encountered.
*   Normalize filenames for consistent storage and retrieval.
