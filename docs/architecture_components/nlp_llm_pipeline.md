# NLP & LLM Pipeline Design

## Overview

The NLP & LLM Pipeline is the core intelligence component, responsible for extracting insights, analyzing sentiment, identifying risks, and generating summaries using advanced natural language processing techniques and large language models.

## Functional Requirements (from `requirements.md`)

*   Embed documents using domain-specific financial embeddings (FinBERT/Custom)
*   Retrieve context using RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation)
*   Design specialized agents for:
    *   Financial metric extraction
    *   Sentiment & tone detection
    *   Risk factor identification
    *   Summary generation
*   Use GPT-based models with prompt engineering templates for extraction tasks

## Working Procedure Steps (from `working_procedure.md`)

*   Embed segments using financial-specific embeddings
*   Use retriever to fetch context for queries
*   Call LLM agents with templates (zero-shot/few-shot)
*   Aggregate insights with source references

## Detailed Design

### Document Embedding

*   Utilize pre-trained domain-specific financial embeddings like FinBERT to represent document segments as dense vectors.
*   Evaluate the need for custom embeddings trained on a larger corpus of financial documents for potentially better performance.
*   Store embeddings in a vector database or index (e.g., using FAISS) for efficient similarity search.

### Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)

*   Implement a RAG mechanism to retrieve relevant document segments based on a user query or an agent's prompt.
*   Store the aggregated insights in a structured format within MongoDB, ready for storage and retrieval.

### NLP Agent Framework

*   Design a modular framework for specialized NLP agents. Each agent will be responsible for a specific task.
*   The framework should manage the flow of data to and from the agents and handle the interaction with the LLM.

### Specialized Agents

*   **Financial Metric Extractor:**
    *   Identifies and extracts key financial metrics (e.g., revenue, net income, EPS) and their corresponding values and periods from the text.
    *   Requires careful prompt engineering for LLMs or fine-tuning of models on financial entity recognition tasks.
*   **Sentiment & Tone Analyzer:**
    *   Determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and tone (e.g., cautious, optimistic) expressed in different sections of the document, particularly in earnings call transcripts and MD&A.
    *   Can use fine-tuned sentiment analysis models or LLMs with appropriate prompts.
*   **Risk Factor Identification:**
    *   Identifies and categorizes risk factors discussed in the document (typically in the "Risk Factors" section).
    *   May involve named entity recognition for risk types and relationship extraction to link risks to potential impacts.
*   **Summary Generator:**
    *   Generates concise summaries of key sections or the entire document.
    *   Can utilize abstractive or extractive summarization techniques, potentially guided by the insights extracted by other agents.

### LLM Integration and Prompt Engineering

*   Integrate with GPT-based models (or other suitable LLMs) for tasks requiring advanced language understanding and generation.
*   Develop and refine prompt engineering templates for each agent to guide the LLM in extracting specific information or generating desired outputs.
*   Consider few-shot learning techniques by providing examples in the prompts to improve performance on specific extraction tasks.

### Insight Aggregation and Referencing

*   Aggregate the insights generated by the different agents.
*   Crucially, link each extracted insight back to its source in the original document (document ID, page number, segment). This is essential for explainability and verification.
*   Store the aggregated insights in a structured format, ready for storage and retrieval.
