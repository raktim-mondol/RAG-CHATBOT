# API & Frontend Integration Design

## Overview

The API & Frontend Integration component provides the interface for users and other systems to interact with the Financial Document Intelligence System, allowing document uploads, insight retrieval, and querying.

## Functional Requirements (from `requirements.md`)

*   Expose REST API endpoints for:
    *   Uploading documents
    *   Retrieving extracted insights
    *   Querying reports by metric/date/company
*   Integrate into analyst tools via dashboard or plugin

## Working Procedure Steps (from `working_procedure.md`)

*   Provide endpoints to:
    *   Upload document and fetch insights
    *   Run specific analysis (e.g., extract revenue)
*   Integrate into tools via UI or CLI wrapper

## Detailed Design

### API Layer (FastAPI)

*   Utilize FastAPI to build the RESTful API due to its high performance, automatic documentation (Swagger UI), and ease of use.
*   Define clear API endpoints for each required function.

### API Endpoints

*   `POST /documents/upload`: Allows users to upload financial documents. The API should handle receiving the file and triggering the ingestion and processing pipeline. Returns a document ID or processing status.
*   `GET /insights/{document_id}`: Retrieves all extracted insights for a specific document.
*   `GET /insights/query`: Allows querying insights based on parameters like company ID, date range, document type, and metric name. Supports filtering and sorting.
*   `POST /analyze/{document_id}`: (Optional) Allows triggering specific analysis tasks on an already uploaded document and returning the results directly.
*   `GET /companies`: Retrieves a list of companies available in the system.
*   `GET /metrics`: Retrieves a list of available financial metrics.

### Request and Response Formats

*   Use JSON for request and response bodies.
*   Define clear data models for requests (e.g., document upload metadata) and responses (e.g., insight structure including value, metric, source reference).

### Authentication and Authorization

*   Implement a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., API keys, OAuth2) to protect API endpoints.
*   Implement authorization to control which users or systems can access specific data or perform certain actions based on their roles.

### Integration with Frontend or Analyst Tools

*   The API is designed to be consumed by a frontend application (dashboard) or integrated directly into existing analyst tools (e.g., Excel plugins, internal dashboards).
*   Provide clear API documentation to facilitate integration.
*   Consider providing client libraries or SDKs for easier integration in common languages.

### Error Handling

*   Implement comprehensive error handling and return meaningful error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
*   Log API requests and responses for monitoring and debugging.
