# Monitoring & Feedback Design

## Overview

The Monitoring & Feedback component is crucial for ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and continuous improvement of the Financial Document Intelligence System. It involves tracking system performance, evaluating the quality of extracted insights, and incorporating human feedback.

## Functional Requirements (from `requirements.md`)

*   Human-in-the-loop review dashboard
*   Accuracy metrics dashboard (precision/recall, drift detection)
*   Logging of model predictions and corrections

## Working Procedure Steps (from `working_procedure.md`)

*   Compare outputs against human-labeled gold data
*   Trigger alerts on drift or quality drop
*   Log feedback into training datasets for fine-tuning

## Detailed Design

### Monitoring System Performance

*   Utilize monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track key system metrics such as:
    *   Ingestion rate and success rate
    *   Processing time per document
    *   API response times and error rates
    *   MongoDB performance (query times, connection pool usage)
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU if applicable)
*   Set up alerts for anomalies or performance degradation.

### Accuracy Metrics Dashboard

*   Develop a dashboard to visualize key evaluation metrics (from `evaluation_metrics.md`) such as:
    *   Precision, Recall, and F1-score for entity extraction.
    *   ROUGE scores for summarization.
    *   Drift detection metrics to identify changes in data distribution or model performance over time.
*   Compare automated extraction results against a human-labeled "gold standard" dataset.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review Dashboard

*   Design a user interface where human analysts can review the insights extracted by the system.
*   Allow analysts to correct incorrect extractions, add missing information, and provide feedback on the quality and relevance of the insights.
*   This dashboard should display the extracted insight alongside the original text snippet and document reference.

### Logging Predictions and Corrections

*   Log all model predictions and the corresponding input data.
*   Crucially, log any corrections or feedback provided by human reviewers through the HITL dashboard. This data is invaluable for identifying areas for improvement and creating datasets for model fine-tuning.

### Feedback Loop for Model Improvement

*   Establish a process for using the logged predictions and human corrections to retrain or fine-tune the NLP/LLM models.
*   Periodically evaluate the models against updated gold standard datasets to measure improvement and detect drift.
*   Implement a CI/CD pipeline (from `technology_stack.md`) that can automate the retraining and deployment of updated models.

### Alerting and Notifications

*   Set up an alerting system to notify administrators or relevant personnel when:
    *   System performance metrics cross predefined thresholds.
    *   Drift detection indicates a significant drop in model quality.
    *   Error rates for specific components increase.
