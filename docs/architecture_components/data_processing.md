# Data Processing Design

## Overview

The Data Processing component is responsible for cleaning and normalizing the extracted text, handling complex elements like tables and formulas, and converting structured content into a usable format, such as JSON.

## Functional Requirements (from `requirements.md`)

*   Clean financial text (remove noise, normalize numbers)
*   Handle tables, formulas, and footnotes
*   Convert structured content into JSON format

## Working Procedure Steps (from `working_procedure.md`)

*   Apply segmentation rules: identify headers, footnotes, tables
*   Clean and tokenize content

## Detailed Design

### Text Cleaning and Normalization

*   Remove irrelevant characters, special symbols, and excessive whitespace.
*   Handle common financial abbreviations and jargon.
*   Normalize numerical formats (e.g., converting "$1,000,000" to "1000000").
*   Address potential OCR errors if documents were sourced from scanned images.

### Handling Tables and Formulas

*   Develop methods to detect and extract data from tables within the document text. This may involve analyzing spatial layout and using libraries like `camelot` or `tabula-py` for PDF tables.
*   For formulas, the goal is primarily to identify and potentially extract them, though full mathematical parsing might be out of scope initially.
*   Extract footnotes and link them to the text they reference where possible.

### Structured Content Conversion to JSON

*   Based on the document segmentation and extraction of tables/key data points, structure the information into a JSON format.
*   Define a schema for the JSON output that can accommodate various types of financial information (e.g., key metrics, dates, textual descriptions, table data).
*   Ensure the JSON output includes references back to the original document and specific page/segment locations for traceability.

### Tokenization and Preprocessing for NLP

*   Tokenize the cleaned text into words or sub-word units using appropriate NLP libraries (e.g., `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `transformers`).
*   Perform further preprocessing steps as required by the NLP models, such as stemming, lemmatization, or stop word removal, depending on the specific task.
